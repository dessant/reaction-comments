# Reaction Comments

Reaction Comments is a GitHub Action that deletes reaction comments,
such as +1, and encourages the use of GitHub reactions.

## Supporting the Project

The continued development of Reaction Comments is made possible
thanks to the support of awesome backers. If you'd like to join them,
please consider contributing with
[Patreon](https://armin.dev/go/patreon?pr=reaction-comments&src=repo),
[PayPal](https://armin.dev/go/paypal?pr=reaction-comments&src=repo) or
[Bitcoin](https://armin.dev/go/bitcoin?pr=reaction-comments&src=repo).

## How It Works

The action detects if new or edited comments consist solely of emojis
and shortcodes used in GitHub reactions. Matching comments are replaced with
the message set in `issue-comment` or `pr-comment`, and deleted after a day.
When the `issue-comment` or `pr-comment` parameter is set to `''`,
matching comments are immediately deleted.

## Usage

Create the `reaction-comments.yml` workflow file in the `.github/workflows`
directory, use one of the [example workflows](#examples) to get started.

## Examples

The following workflow will replace new or edited reaction comments
with a helpful message, and delete them after a day.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
name: 'Reaction Comments'

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created, edited]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created, edited]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'

permissions:
  actions: write
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  action:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: dessant/reaction-comments@v3
```

### Available input parameters

This workflow declares all the available input parameters of the action
and their default values. Any of the parameters can be omitted.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
name: 'Reaction Comments'

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created, edited]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created, edited]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'

permissions:
  actions: write
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  action:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: dessant/reaction-comments@v3
        with:
          github-token: ${{ github.token }}
          exempt-issue-labels: ''
          issue-comment: >
            :wave: @{comment-author}, would you like to leave
            a reaction instead?
          exempt-pr-labels: ''
          pr-comment: >
            :wave: @{comment-author}, would you like to leave
            a reaction instead?
          process-only: ''
          log-output: false
```

### Ignoring comments

This step will process comments only on issues, and ignore threads
with the the `help` or `party-parrot` labels applied.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
    steps:
      - uses: dessant/reaction-comments@v3
        with:
          exempt-issue-labels: 'help, party-parrot'
          process-only: 'issues'
```

This step will process comments only on pull requests, and ignore threads
with the `pinned` label applied.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
    steps:
      - uses: dessant/reaction-comments@v3
        with:
          exempt-pr-labels: 'pinned'
          process-only: 'prs'
```

### Deleting comments

By default, reaction comments are replaced with a message and deleted
after a day. This step will immediately delete new or edited reaction comments
on issues and pull requests.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
    steps:
      - uses: dessant/reaction-comments@v3
        with:
          issue-comment: ''
          pr-comment: ''
```

### Using a personal access token

The action uses an installation access token by default to interact with GitHub.
You may also authenticate with a personal access token to perform actions
as a GitHub user instead of the `github-actions` app.

Create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
with the `repo` or `public_repo` scopes enabled, and add the token as an
[encrypted secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)
for the repository or organization, then provide the action with the secret
using the `github-token` input parameter.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
    steps:
      - uses: dessant/reaction-comments@v3
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```
